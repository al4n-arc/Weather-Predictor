# 🌫️ Weather Prediction Using Air Pollution Data
This project predicts weather-related values using air pollution data. It uses a machine learning regression model trained in Python and provides a simple user interface built with Streamlit.






📁 Files Included
W_Backend.ipynb – Backend code to train the ML model.

W_Predictor(Frntend).py – Frontend app using Streamlit.

ModelRegr.pkl – Trained machine learning model.

dataset.csv – Dataset used for training (add your file here).

Screenshots and Lottie animations for visuals.
